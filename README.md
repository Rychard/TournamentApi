This is a clone of an existing repository hosted on CodePlex.

The original CodePlex repository was listed as having the MIT License, hence the additional [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/Rychard/TournamentApi/blob/master/LICENSE) file in the root of the repository, which should mirror the contents of the [License Page](https://tournaments.codeplex.com/license) for the source repository.

When pushing the existing commit history to GitHub, the commits were associated with [@otac0n](https://github.com/otac0n), whose username matches the one used on the source repository.  I checked to see if the repository had already been moved from CodePlex to Github, but I didn't find anything.

This project contains the code that was used to run the [Stack Overflow Battleship Competition](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1631414/what-is-the-best-battleship-ai).
